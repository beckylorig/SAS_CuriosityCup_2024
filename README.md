# SAS Curiosity Cup 2024
Project outline and public data sources used for the SAS 2024 Curiosity Cup

## Project Overview
The purpose of the SAS Curiosity Cup is to provide students the opportunity to analyze public data using SAS tools with the guidance of an advisor to build analytics skills, SAS familiarity, and write a report of their findings.

My team of two students chose to combine publicly available mining location data with documented forced labor and child labor commodities and countries.  The analysis of the data and report will be the final products of the project.  The project idea is based on initial findings of the 2023 SAS Hackathon project by team "End Forced Labor" that was a regional winner in the competition.
